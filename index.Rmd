## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(httr2)
library(usethis)
req <- request("https://newsapi.org/v2/everything") %>%
  req_url_query(
    q = '`"data science"`',
    from = Sys.Date() - 1,
    pageSize = 10,
    apiKey = Sys.getenv("NEWS_API_KEY")
  )

resp <- req_perform(req)
resp_body_json(resp)
#new cmt2
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
